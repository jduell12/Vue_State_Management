# What is Vuex?
- state management and pattern library
- used most commonly with the Vue framework
- very similar to Redux, Flux etc (but easier)
- centralized store for all components 

# Why use Vuex?
- components need to share state in many cases
- Vuex provides a single source of truth for data/state
- No need to pass events up and props down through multiple components
- Global state is "reactive"
    - update state in one component will update the same state in other components
